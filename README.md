# CISE-SEPER-App
CISE App Project

Product Overview:
- Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database (SEPER).
- Searchable database of evidence about differents claims on different SE Practices.

- Any student, practitioner or researcher will be able to look for evidence related to claims about SE Practices
by searching the database through a summary of published relevant research evidence for or against the claims.

- Anyone can suggest an article to be included within the SEPER Database through a submission form, these entries will be moderated and analyzed 
by SE experts (Software Engineering Research Lab - SERL @AUT).

- Submitted articles will go into a queue in SEPER for SERL moderators to perform a quality check.
- These moderators will be notified by SEPER if there are any submissions waiting in queue. The moderators will receive a list of submissions
awaiting moderation.
- Moderators will be able to see if the submitted article has been submitted/rejected previously, if its relevant to SE.

- Articles passed by the moderator will  go into a seperate queue for SERL Analysts to work on.
- These analysys will be notified if there are any papers in queue ready for analyzing.
- Analysts will extract appropriate information and enter them into SEPER.
- Bibliographic information will be automatically transfered from the information submitted.
- Rejected papers will go into a Rejected Paper Database.

- Submitters are notified of the outcome of moderation (accepted or rejected).

- Intially results can be displayed in a table with each article source with evidence result for the claim shown in a different row.
- The columns to be displayed can include title, authors, year of publication, journal name, SE practice, claim, result of evidence 
(e.g. agree or disagree), type of research (e.g. case study, experiment), type of participant (eg. Student, practitioner).
- Users should be able to sort by any column and select which columns to display.
- Other ways of displaying and filtering results will be considered in the future.
